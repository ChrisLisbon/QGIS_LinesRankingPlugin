# About us 

Welcome to the section where you can find some information about the Lines Ranking plugin development team. 
We implemented the first version of this plugin in the summer of 2020 during the work in [“State Hydrological Institute” (SHI)](http://www.hydrology.ru/en). 

Then this plugin was implemented to automate the map preparation process. 
At that time we needed to display the aggregate number of tributaries in the rivers by elements of different width. 
So in order not to assign ranks to the river elements manually, we wrote several functions that allowed us to speed up the process. 

## The team

Our lab were specialized in spatial analysis using contemporary technologies such as 
machine learning, backend and fronted tools for spatial services and scientific 
approach to finish our projects.

At the moment (winter 2024) we are no longer working together (nevertheless, 
we still write code or/and scientific papers), but in the summer of 
2020 our team consisted of three people:

- [Eduard Kazakov](https://github.com/eduard-kazakov), researcher - supervising, spatial and remote sensing analysis, full stack;
- [Julia Borisova](https://github.com/ChrisLisbon), a junior researcher - GIS specialist, full stack;
- [Mikhail Sarafanov](https://github.com/Dreamlone), a junior researcher - GIS specialist, machine learning and DS-related algorithms development
