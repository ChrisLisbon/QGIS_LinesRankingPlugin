# Lines ranking (QGIS)

QGIS plugin for ranking lines features based on the position of starting point

## Brief description

The plugin calculates the rank of each segment of the connected river 
network, and the number of tributaries flowing into the segment.

The algorithm is based on constructing a mathematical representation of 
the network in the form of a graph, taking into account the segment length. 
The output can be used for cartographic visualizations and network explorations.

## Documentation 

The Lines Ranking plugin can be used for road network analysis and stream ordering (for example, for calculating Shreve stream order).
Usage examples and detailed description of the algorithm can be found in the documentation.

The official plugin documentation can be reached via [link](https://linesranking.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
