# Lines ranking (QGIS)

QGIS plugin for ranking lines features based on the position of starting point

## Brief description

The plugin calculates the rank of each segment of the connected river 
network, and the number of tributaries flowing into the segment.

The algorithm is based on constructing a mathematical representation of 
the network in the form of a graph, taking into account the segment length. 
The output can be used for cartographic visualizations and network explorations.
