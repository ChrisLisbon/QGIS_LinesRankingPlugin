about=The plugin calculates the rank of each segment of the connected river network and the number of tributaries flowing into the segment.
      The algorithm is based on constructing a mathematical representation of the network in the form of a graph, taking into account the segment length. The output can be used for cartographical visualizations and network explorations.
      Required dependencies (python libraries): pandas, networkx. $pip install pandas $pip install networkx (for QGIS python interpreter, see docs for details)
